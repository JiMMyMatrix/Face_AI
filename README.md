You need to download some python modules in requirement and some of them are not fitting your env, so i recommand that you use pipenv to manage env
Optional, run
```
pipenv
```
Then execute program by
```
python ./main
```

And the tcp client content is in reconition.py with functions init_TCP_conn() and recognize_cam(detector, sess, db_path)
